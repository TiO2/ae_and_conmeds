# Adverse Events and Concommitant Medications Forms

These forms provide a standards-based method of reporting Adverse Event and Concommitant Medications on a clinical trial. They use REDCap's text auto-completion and the MEDDRA, ATC, and RxNorm ontologies to provided assisted text entry and validation of data entry.  These features simplify the aggregation and sharing of medication and adverse event data in clinical trials.

## Requirements

These forms require features first release in REDCap 6.7.0 and were developed using in REDCap 6.8.1.  These forms use reference ontologies served by http://data.bioontology.org  Access to that service requires an API key from http://bioportal.bioontology.org/  No special REDCap extensions are required.

## Installation

These forms are distributed as a REDCap instrument

## Contributors

These forms are based on work by Ken Bergquist done for the [HCV Target](http://www.hcvtarget.org/) project.  These forms were adapted for use at the University of Florida by Philip Chase <pbc@ufl.edu> and Ruchi V. Desai <ruchivdesai@gmail.com>.  Many thanks to David Nelson, MD, Director of UF's Clinical Translational Science Institute and Principal Investigator on the HCV Target project for his support of this work.
